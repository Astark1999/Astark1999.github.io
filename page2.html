	<p>Lego, as a hobby</p>
	<p class="secondary">It all started when I was about 8 years old. I was asking for newer and newer sets, but after a while I wanted to build something by myself, what is unique and has a lot of functions at the same time. Thats when I really started to play around with Technic. The next step for me is making instructions for each one of my proper builds, and sell them on an offical website of "Lego Mocs".</p>
